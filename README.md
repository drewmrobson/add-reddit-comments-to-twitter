# add-reddit-comments-to-twitter

Post comments you've saved in Reddit to Twitter as tweets.

# Overview

When reading Reddit, I often save comments that resonate with me. What else to do with all these saved comments but share them with the world via Twitter?

This app will take one comment from your saved comments, post it as a tweet with a link back to the comment, then remove it from your saved comments.

# Running

```
git clone https://github.com/drewmrobson/add-reddit-comments-to-twitter.git
cd add-reddit-comments-to-twitter
python main.py x x
```
